Tako Welcome to the void!
Player Isn't this your room?
Tako Welcome to the void *aka my room*!
Player Ok...
Tako Because the programmers have nothing else to do,
Tako you're stuck here until you solve my puzzle!
Player ugh 
Tako Don't be like that.
Tako Look around the room for objects you can pick up.
Tako When you think you have enough, press 'c' and select the object that answer my riddles!
Tako You can leave once you finish that.
Player I don't have a choice do I.
Tako Nope! Have fun!
