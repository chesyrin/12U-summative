Envelope 1 A sealed envelope. The address is smudged, but there seems to be paper inside... You try to open it, but the seal is too strong.
Fork 2 An unused plastic fork. You picked it up from the trash but it'll come in handy...right?
Mirror 3 A surprisingly clean mirror. You think it cracks a little as you peer into it, but it might just be your imagination.
